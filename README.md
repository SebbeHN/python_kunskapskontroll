# ðŸ“š Python Knowledge Assessment 

This repository contains the submission for the Python Knowledge Assessment as part of the NBI program that i am studying. The project consists of two main parts:

---

## ðŸš€ Part 1: Theoretical Questions and Python Exercises

This section includes:

- Answers to theoretical questions about Python, object-oriented programming, causality, and statistical measures.
- Practical Python exercises, including:
  - Creation of a `BankAccount` class.
  - A function to count vowels in a string.
  - A function to find common elements between two lists.
- Reflection and self-evaluation.

All solutions and answers are documented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ“Š Part 2: Data Analysis & Visualization of the Diamonds Dataset

In this section, a dataset related to diamonds is analyzed to provide business insights for the company **Guldfynd**, which is considering expanding its product line with diamond-based products.

### Contents:

- Data import and exploratory data analysis.
- Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas.
- Statistical analysis and insights regarding diamond prices and features.
- An **Executive Summary** providing key insights and business recommendations.

An interactive **Streamlit application** has also been developed to present the most important findings in a user-friendly way.
